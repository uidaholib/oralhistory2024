[00:00:00],Matteo Milani ,"This is Matteo Milani interviewing my grandpa, Tony Cole from Santa Rosa, California. How would you describe daily life in the 60's? How do you think it is different from today? How is it the same? ",Culture
,Tony Cole,"Well, I was a teenager in the early 60's. I didn't care about politics. Vietnam was going on, I lost a lot of friends. I've alwasy been behind the government, even today, but over the years i've come to the conclusion that we lost a lot of boys for nothing. So, I was wrong back then, but you know, what i'm gonna call the ""hippies,"" I was not one of them. I hold them to it for being against the government. ",Vietnam; politics
[00:01:30],MM*,Would you say the politics were similar to how the left and right are today?,Politics
,TC*,"Yeah, uh, they're lazy (chuckle) the Hate Ashbury scene, I was not into. They marched against the governement, and they had that free-spirit attitude with no rules. So I hold that to the young people of today. They're not working, they're against the government for no reason. Well, not searching out their reasoning, they're just going with the party atmosphere like in the 60's. Vietnam was a very big mistake. We have that going on now, but like I said, I'm pro government, I'm pro laws, and the hippies were on the other side of that fence. ",Politics; Vietnam
,MM*,"Yeah, their movement wasn't too happy with the government (chuckle)",
,TC*,"We all did the partying, drugs, the 50's started the 60's. ",Culture
,MM*,How so?,
,TC*,"Meaning the music, the attitude, the freedom, the cars going up and down the streets touring. And then my generation, about 5-6 years younger, we went into the 60's and continued that. The drugs were free, the partying was free. A big mistake (chuckle) A lot of years wasted.",Culture
[00:04:19],MM*,"Would you look back on it as a good time, or would you have liked to have done things differently?",
,TC*,"A good time in the partying, but not a good time in wasting years. You know, i'm a firm believer that drugs stop your growth. So it took me a lot of years to figure that out. So, again, I lost a lot of years that I could have been productive, and be in better shape than i'm in now, meaning financially, matterial things.",Culture
,MM*,So what was your favorite kind of music to listen to back then? And did you feel like it had an influence on you?,Culture
,TC*,"Well I met your grandmother at the Doors dance, or concert. The music carried over from the 50's and got more radical in the 60's. The 50's with Elvis, and Big Bopper, and Fats Domino. That kinda rubbed the adults wrong, and the 60's got to the Doors, the words, the lyrics, the music tempo, concerts. That didn't happen back in the 50's and 40's. We ran with that, The Philmore, in San Franscisco, there was no rules (chuckle) You just partied your heart out, and hoped you got home (chuckle)",Culture
,MM*,Seems like it all worked out (chuckle),
,TC*,"Well, yes and no. Like I said, at this phase of my life, I do not believe in the freedom of drugs. I watched my friends, and I watched my life, i've come to that conclusion",Culture
00:07:19],MM*,"Ok, so it sounds like the music did have a pretty big impact.",
,TC*,"Yes, yes it was the music and the drugs and everybody was on the same page with the lyrics. It was not Frank Sinatra (chuckle) it was loud and about freedom. Woodstock, I never made it to Woodstock, but Woodstock tells the whole picture of the 60's and early 70's. ",Culture
,MM*,Was that something you would have liked to have gone to?,
,TC*,Yes (chuckle) but I did not have a vehicle that would have made it,
,MM*,Oh dang (chuckle),
,TC*,"But we did Altamont, and the Philmore, and others like those concerts that were local. I don't know if you know anything about the Philmore, but they had, you know, Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Jimi Hendrix, those musicians. ",Culture
,MM*,Oh that's awesome.,
,TC*,"Yes, yes, I don't regret being young in the 60's, but I did waste a lot of time. People tell me all the time, you're lucky you were a teenager, and early twenties, in the 60's. Yes, but I think things could have been different. The drugs made a big difference. You know, my folks and the adults at that time, you take a puff of marijuana and you're hooked for life. Well that proved to be wrong, so the next step, and the next step, and the next, and that led to partying. ",Culture
,MM*,"Ok, so similar to music, how do you remember televison? Has it changed a lot?",Media
,TC*,"In the 60's I was never around the home much, I remember Leave It to Beaver (chuckle), the American all around family programming. And then Saturday Night Live started, and that broke the all American home life. So Saturday Night Live was in sync with the times. They broke the barriers of talking about different subjects, and putting the government down, and the humor all went with the times. ",Media; Culture
[00:10:50],MM*,Was it cool to watch that unfold?,
,TC*,"Well, I don't remember it as unfolding. At my age now, I can remember it unfolding, but at the time that was just life. You didn't have to worry about tomorrow and consequences. It was just a good time everyday. ",Culture
,MM*,"Yeah that's kind of the interesting part about looking back, you don't really realize the effect while it's happening. ",
,TC*,"Yeah, I lost a lot of friends, not overdose, but medical. The drugs, like liver diseases, car wrecks, and motorcycle wrecks. So it was a good time, and a bad time, if that makes sense. ",Culture
,MM*,"Yeah, yeah, I get you. Well, i'm sorry to hear that. ",
,TC*,"Then the Vietnam War was going on all this time. So I guess it holds true today. You have two sides to a coin. You have the hippies with their peace sign marching against the government, I was on the other side. The government was right, the government was your shepard, and so we clashed with the hippies. But then there were the concerts, you know, we were all together, but seperate. ",Vietnam; Politics
,MM*,"So you liked the same music, but not the same politics. ",
,TC*,"Yup, exactly, and it showed. Like I said, I met your grandmother at the Doors dance, and that's pretty radical music. But yeah, that was the 60's and early 70's. You listen to the words of the doors and its pretty radical. But at that time it was good music. Big Brother and the Holding Company, Janis Joplin, and I pretty much did not listen to the music, as much as I did the tempo, and the atmosphere around it. Now I look back onto the words and (chuckle) i'm at awe with the lyrics. ",Culture
,MM*,"Ok, so let's move on the Civil Rights Movement. Do you remember it happening? Like did it have a big impact on your daily life? Or did you not really notice it as much?",CRM
,TC*,"No, no that was never... I watched the news, and we talked about it, you know, Martin Luther King, but no. I had very good friends that were black, but uh no, I mean my door was never closed.",CRM; media 
,MM*,"Ok then we can move on to my last question. You already kinda answered this, but concerning the Vietnam War, how did you feel that it affected your community? ",Vietnam
,TC*,"It was divided. They came home... well I had a lot of friends and we used to go the Italian deli and buy a care package of meats and cheeses and breads and ship it over to my friends. I wrote letters to them, and I was backing what they were there for. Well when they got home, I was kind of laughed at. I was way off base from what they were feeling. They were there, and I was here, driving up and down the streets and partying. They were being shot at away from home and away from friends, and I didn't understand that at the time. Like I said, I wrote letters to them, and I was backing them. And when they came home they laid into me. You know, ""what are you writing,"" and ""it was bad over there."" It wasn't a good war. Should've never been started in the first place. And then when they came home, they were spit on, and they were called baby-killers, and that's not true. ",Vietnam
[00:17:46],MM*,Yeah that's tough.,
,TC*,"Colateral damage, naturally the civilians and children and so forth in the way. But you know eighteen years old, nineteen years old, I was still in Santa Rosa partying, going to the Philmore, dating and all that kinda stuff, and they were there. Seeing the ugly part of war, and when they came home, they were not treated like war veterans today. And I think that people learned off of that. You know, service members come home from Iraq and Afghanistan and they're treated really well. But the hippies and the far left liberals, boy they hammered them. And that was confusing, mental issues, I have a couple of friends who never came home mentally. And they should've been greeted with open arms. It was not a war that should have been fought. Then it was a political war, my father, lifer in the marine core, served three duties over there as a gunny. And it was a politcal war, meaning politicians who are ran by the mothers of the soldiers, ran that war.",Vietnam; Politics
,TC*,"My dad would take a position, and then the next day give it up. And then a week later take that position back. The military did not run the war. The politics did. And the politics are ran by mothers, and families. So that's my take of why we lost so many young people. Your grandmother lost her childhood friend, I lost three or four friends, and a couple of them mentaly never came home. Your great grandpa, my dad, fought World War 2, Korea, and three duties in Vietnam. When he was home he used to stay with me and your grandma, and he used to say that it was goofy. It was not fought like World War 2 or Korea, it was civillians fighting the military, and military killing civillians, and poisoning their crops, and so forth. Your great grandpa was down on the military part of it. He was proud of World War 2 and Korea, because those were issues that needed to be resolved. Vietnam was not an issue to be solved. It was political. And today we didn't accomplish anything. Vietnam is still communist. Forty or I guess fifty thousand young men died for no reason. Not counting the people who came home mental, and without limbs. For no reason. ",Vietnam; Politics
,MM*,Yeah it's a real rough point in American history. ,
,TC*,"But back in the 60's I was all for it. The government was gonna kill all the comunists and gonna save America. It wasn't until years later that I realized, and did a little reading, and realized it was not a war that had an end. ",Vietnam
,MM*,"Yeah, yeah that's really tough. ",
,TC*,"Yeah, like I said , I got hell from my friends that came home. I was promoting the war (chuckle) you know go get em guys, and they were going ""oh boy, you are off base.""",Vietnam
,MM*,Well thank you so much for sharing that information with me. I know it can be tough to talk about. ,
,TC*,I hope I didn't confuse you to my thoughts (chuckle),
,MM*,"Oh no, no.",
,TC*,"You had brought up the memories, and it's been a long time since I thought of the friends that I had lost. War is no good, But it has to be fought for a reason. ",Vietnam
[00:24:54],MM*,Yeah at the very least. ,
,TC*,"Yeah, my dad, your great-grandpa hated politicians. As a gunny, lost a lot of men for the politicians. Politicians need to stay out of the military. The military is trained to know whats best, but the politicians get involved. And they make rank that they never should have made. My dad hated what he called the ""Minutemen"" coming out of college and fighting the battle while turning the page. ""Oh, chapter one, how do we fight this?"" No experience in the field, and got a lot of people killed. Anyway...",Vietnam; Politics
,MM*,"Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to answer some questions for me. ",
,TC*,"Like I said, I hope I answered your questions, and not strung you out wondering what I was saying (chuckle) ",
,MM*,"No, no I thought you did a great job. I like hearing old stories. ",
,TC*,"Yeah, the 60's were crazy times.",
,MM*,That's what I hear.,
[00:28:53],TC*,"It was the start of everything. Before the 50's people did not speak out, kind of like sheep. The 50's broke it and the 60's ran with it. People nowadays speak out on everything. (chuckle)",Culture
